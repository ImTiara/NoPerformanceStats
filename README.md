# NoPerformanceStats
This mod disables the avatar performance scanning and will make (RAM) cached avatars load instantly. Non-cached avatars will also load a bit faster and should decrease the lag spikes when someone changes their avatar. This mod is built using MelonPreferences so its highly recommended to use UIExpansionKit with it.
