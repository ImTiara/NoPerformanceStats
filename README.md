# NoPerformanceStats
This mod disables the avatar performance scanning and will make (RAM)cached avatars load instantly. Non-cached avatars will also load a bit faster and should decrease the lag spikes when someone changes their avatar. This mod is built using ModPrefs so its highly recommended to use UIExpansionKit with it. If you don't want to use UIExpansionKit you can toggle the performance scanner by pressing SHIFT + P on your keyboard.
